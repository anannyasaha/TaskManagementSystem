# Project Name: Task Management System

## Description

This is a full-stack application that allows users to register, sign in, create tasks, and interact with them in real-time. The backend is built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, while the frontend uses React.js for a smooth user interface. The system supports roles such as Manager and Employee, with different permissions for creating, editing, and viewing tasks.

## Requirements

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database to store user and task data.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime for backend development.
- **npm**: Node package manager (comes with Node.js).
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces (frontend).
- **VS Code (optional)**: A code editor (or any code editor of your choice).

### Step 1: Install Required Software

#### Install MongoDB

1. **Download MongoDB**: Follow the installation instructions from the official website: [MongoDB Download](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).
2. **Run MongoDB Locally**:
   After installation, start MongoDB using the command:
   ```bash
   mongod
   ```
   This starts the MongoDB service on your local machine.

#### Install Node.js and npm

1. **Download Node.js**: Install Node.js from the official website: [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org/).
2. **Verify Installation**: Open a terminal and verify that Node.js and npm are installed:
   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```

### Step 2: Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository to your local machine by running:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/anannyasaha/TaskManagementSystem.git
```

### Step 3: Set Up the Backend

1. **Navigate to the Backend Directory**:
   Open the project in VS Code and navigate to the `App2/server` folder:
   ```bash
   cd App2/server
   ```

2. **Install Backend Dependencies**:
   Run the following command to install all required backend dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory.
   - Add the following environment variables to the `.env` file:
     ```
     MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/task-manager
     PORT=7000
     ```

4. **Run the Backend Server**:
   Start the backend by running:
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

   The backend will now be running on `http://localhost:7000`.

### Step 4: Set Up the Frontend

1. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory**:
   Open another terminal and navigate to the `client` folder:
   ```bash
   cd App2/client
   ```

2. **Install Frontend Dependencies**:
   Run the following command to install all required frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Frontend Server**:
   Start the frontend by running:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The frontend will now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Step 5: Interact with the Website

- Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.
- You should now see the homepage with two options: **Register** and **Sign In**.
  - **Sign In**: Enter your registered email and password to sign in.
  - **Register**: If you're a new user, you can register by providing necessary information such as your name, email, password, and role (Manager or Employee).
  
Once logged in, you can start interacting with the task management system.

- **Manager**: Can create tasks for employees, assign tasks to themselves or employees, and view/edit/delete tasks.
- **Employee**: Can only create tasks for themselves and view/edit their assigned tasks.

### Step 6: Real-Time Notifications

- When a new task is created, real-time notifications are pushed to the screen, allowing the user to stay updated with new tasks immediately.

### Step 7: Edit, View, or Delete Tasks

- You can click on any task to **view**, **edit**, or **delete** it.

## Troubleshooting

- **MongoDB Issues**: Ensure MongoDB is running locally. You can check by running `mongod` in your terminal.
- **Frontend Not Loading**: Check the browser console for errors related to missing dependencies or configuration.
- **Backend Not Running**: Ensure that the backend server is running on `http://localhost:7000` and that the `.env` file is correctly set up.
- **CORS Issues**: If you're facing issues with CORS, ensure that the `client` is running on `http://localhost:3000` and the `server` is properly set to allow requests from the frontend.
